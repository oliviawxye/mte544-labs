# Rubric for Lab 4: In-lab Evaluation
As suggested by Professor Jeon, there is **no report required for Lab 4**. 
However, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of your understanding and implementation of the A star planning and all the labs, we have designed the following rubric for grading your lab work.

## Pre-lab Submission: 10 marks
- ```10``` marks for submitting a first version of the completed code before the group's lab section.

## Part 3: Map Acquisition and Saving: 10 marks
- ```10``` marks for successful map acquisition and saving as `room` map.

## Part 4 & 5: Understanding of A Star Planning and the Whole Autonomous Mobile Robot System: 40 marks
- ```20``` marks for explaining the A star planning algorithm to a TA.
    - Explain the following components:
        - Two Heuristic functions (h Manhattan and Euclidean).
        - Cost functions (g, h, f).
        - How to select the next node to expand.
    - Why A star is more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm.
- ```20``` marks for explaining the integration of all components in the autonomous mobile robot system to a TA.
    - What components you have implemented in this lab series (L1 to L4).
    - The role of each component in the overall system.
    - How these components work together to enable autonomous navigation.


## Part 6: Robot Navigation using A Star Planning: 40 marks
- ```10``` marks for successful implementation of A star planning for robot navigation (showing planned path on RViz).
- ```30``` marks for the robot successfully navigating from start to goal positions without collisions (3 experiments will be conducted).
    - Two goal positions using one heuristic function.
    - One goal position using the other heuristic function.
# Total: 100 marks

Good luck!
